# Clone Assessment Criteria

Scoring methodology for evaluating clone opportunities.

## 7-Dimension Scoring System

Each dimension scored 1-10. Higher scores indicate better clone opportunity (except where noted).

### 1. Market Demand Evidence

Evidence that customers want and pay for this solution.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Multiple funded competitors, strong reviews, proven pain point, growing search volume |
| 7-8 | Some competitors succeeding, positive user sentiment, clear use cases |
| 5-6 | Emerging market, early competitors, some validation |
| 3-4 | Niche market, unclear demand, few success stories |
| 1-2 | No validation, purely speculative, no competitors |

**Evidence Sources:**
- Number of competitors with funding
- G2/Capterra review volume and ratings
- Google Trends search volume
- Reddit/forum discussion activity
- Industry report mentions

### 2. Technical Complexity (Lower = Better for Cloning)

How difficult is it to build an MVP?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Simple CRUD app, standard tech stack, no special infra |
| 7-8 | Moderate complexity, available libraries/frameworks |
| 5-6 | Some custom development, third-party integrations |
| 3-4 | Significant technical challenges, specialized skills |
| 1-2 | Deep tech (AI/ML core), years of R&D, proprietary algorithms |

**Complexity Indicators:**
- Tech stack (standard vs. specialized)
- Real-time requirements
- Data processing needs
- Integration complexity
- Mobile/cross-platform needs

### 3. Regulatory Barriers (Lower = Better)

Legal and compliance requirements to operate.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | No regulation, operate anywhere |
| 7-8 | Light compliance (privacy policy, ToS) |
| 5-6 | Moderate regulation (GDPR, data privacy) |
| 3-4 | Heavy regulation (finance, health) - licenses needed |
| 1-2 | Requires specific certifications, government approval |

**Regulatory Considerations:**
- Industry-specific licenses
- Data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA)
- Financial regulations (PCI-DSS, money transmission)
- Healthcare compliance (HIPAA)
- Geographic restrictions

### 4. Network Effects Moat (Lower = Better)

How much does the product's value depend on user base?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | No network effects - standalone tool/utility |
| 7-8 | Light network effects - social features optional |
| 5-6 | Moderate - marketplace with some liquidity |
| 3-4 | Strong two-sided market, data moat |
| 1-2 | Winner-take-all platform, extreme network effects |

**Network Effect Types:**
- Direct: More users = more value (social networks)
- Indirect: More sellers = more buyers (marketplaces)
- Data: More data = better product (AI/ML)
- Platform: More developers = more apps (ecosystems)

### 5. Geographic Opportunity

Is there an underserved geographic market?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | US-only product, clear international gap, no localization |
| 7-8 | Regional focus, clear expansion opportunity |
| 5-6 | Some geographic coverage, gaps in specific regions |
| 3-4 | Global product, localized in major markets |
| 1-2 | Fully global, deep localization, local competitors |

**Geographic Opportunities:**
- Language localization gaps
- Payment method coverage
- Regulatory arbitrage
- Cultural adaptation needs
- Local competitor strength

### 6. Pricing Room

Is there space for a different pricing strategy?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Expensive incumbent ($500+/mo), clear undercut opportunity |
| 7-8 | Room for budget alternative, premium pricing possible |
| 5-6 | Competitive pricing market, some room |
| 3-4 | Race to bottom, thin margins |
| 1-2 | Free/freemium dominant, hard to monetize |

**Pricing Strategies:**
- Undercut: 50-70% of incumbent pricing
- Value-based: Different feature bundles
- Usage-based: Pay-as-you-go alternative
- Freemium: Free tier not available from incumbent

### 7. Feature Gap Opportunity

Are there clear feature improvements to differentiate?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Clear missing features, vocal user complaints, easy wins |
| 7-8 | Improvement opportunities identified, some gaps |
| 5-6 | Moderate gaps, requires creativity |
| 3-4 | Feature-complete products, hard to differentiate |
| 1-2 | Mature market, saturated features, parity expected |

**Gap Discovery Methods:**
- G2/Capterra review complaints
- Reddit/forum feature requests
- Support page FAQ analysis
- Competitor comparison marketing
- User interviews

## Overall Score Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Overall Score = Sum of all 7 dimensions / 7
```

**Interpretation:**

| Score Range | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 8.0 - 10.0 | **Strong Clone Candidate** - Clear opportunity, proceed with confidence |
| 6.0 - 7.9 | **Moderate Opportunity** - Viable with right strategy, address weaknesses |
| 4.0 - 5.9 | **Weak Opportunity** - Significant challenges, reconsider or pivot |
| Below 4.0 | **Not Recommended** - Strong moats, saturated market, or high risk |

## Clone Decision Matrix

| Market Demand | Technical Complexity | Recommendation |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| High (7+) | Low (7+) | **Ideal target** - Fast to market, proven demand |
| High (7+) | Medium (5-6) | **Good target** - Invest in team/time |
| High (7+) | High (1-4) | **Consider acquisition** - Build vs buy analysis |
| Medium (5-6) | Low (7+) | **Validate first** - Quick MVP to test demand |
| Medium (5-6) | Medium (5-6) | **Risky** - Need clear differentiation |
| Low (1-4) | Any | **Avoid** - Demand not proven |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Indicators
- Single strong incumbent with 70%+ market share
- Venture-backed competitors with $50M+ raised
- Strong network effects already established
- Regulated industry requiring licenses
- Proprietary technology or data moat
- Patent-protected core features

### Lower Risk Indicators
- Fragmented market with many players
- Bootstrapped competitors (limited resources)
- Tool/utility without network effects
- Unregulated or lightly regulated
- Standard technology stack
- Clear geographic or vertical gaps

## Post-Assessment Actions

### For Strong Candidates (8+)
1. Deep competitive analysis
2. MVP feature scoping
3. Go-to-market planning
4. Team/resource assessment
5. Begin development

### For Moderate Candidates (6-7.9)
1. Identify specific weaknesses
2. Validate assumptions with user research
3. Develop mitigation strategies
4. Consider pivoting approach
5. Small experiment before commitment

### For Weak Candidates (4-5.9)
1. Reconsider opportunity
2. Look for adjacent opportunities
3. Pivot geography or vertical
4. Wait for market changes
5. Move to next candidate

### For Not Recommended (Below 4)
1. Document learnings
2. Move to next opportunity
3. Monitor for future changes
4. Consider partnership instead of clone
